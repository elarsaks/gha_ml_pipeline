## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Strong foundational components** - Data collection, training, and shipping are well-implemented
2. **Automation-first approach** - GitHub Actions orchestration throughout
3. **Version control** - Both data and model versioning in place
4. **Multi-language architecture** - Appropriate tool selection (Rust for data, Python for ML)

### Critical Gaps
1. **Production monitoring** - No observability into model performance
2. **Continuous improvement** - Limited feedback loops and automated retraining
3. **Evaluation depth** - Missing cross-validation and comprehensive metrics
4. **Operational readiness** - No alerting or drift detection

## Recommendations Priority

### üî¥ High Priority (Block production deployment)
1. **Implement monitoring** - Model performance tracking
2. **Add alerting** - Pipeline failure notifications
3. **Enhance evaluation** - Cross-validation and comprehensive metrics

### üü° Medium Priority (Improve robustness)
1. **Data drift detection** - Statistical monitoring
2. **Experiment tracking** - MLflow integration
3. **Baseline models** - Comparison benchmarks

### üü¢ Low Priority (Future enhancements)
1. **Advanced models** - Beyond linear regression
2. **Feature engineering** - Expanded feature sets
3. **Model serving API** - Dedicated inference endpoints
