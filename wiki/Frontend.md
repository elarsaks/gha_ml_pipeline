# Frontend

The React application in [`react_client/`](../react_client/) displays Bitcoin prices and model predictions.

Useful files:
- `src/` holds TypeScript components and hooks.
- `public/` contains static assets.

The workflow `deploy_react_client.yml` builds the app and publishes it to GitHub Pages. The latest deployment is at <https://elarsaks.github.io/gha_ml_pipeline/>.
